ðŸ¥—** Food Nutrition Estimator**

A simple web application that allows users to input ingredients and instantly get a nutritional analysis of their meal. It calculates calories, protein, carbs, and fats, and provides feedback on meal balance with recommendations.

Features

2.	Provides nutritional breakdown per ingredient.
3.	Calculates total Calories, Protein, Carbs, and Fat.
4.	Analyzes meal balance (Low Protein, High-Carb, High-Fat, Balanced).
5.	Provides personalized recommendations to improve nutrition.
6.	Lightweight, fast, and runs entirely in the browser.
7.	Mobile responsive design.

 
Technologies Used
â€¢	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

â€¢	Backend (optional): Python Flask for a server version

â€¢	IDE: VS Code

How to Run Locally
Option 1: HTML + JS Only
1.	Clone the repo:
git clone <your-repo-url>
2.	Open index.html in your browser or use VS Code Live Server.
Option 2: With Python Flask
1.	Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
2.	Install requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.	Run the server:
python app.py
4.	Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

â”œâ”€ venv/                   # Virtual environment

â”œâ”€ index.html              # Main HTML file

â”œâ”€ style.css               # CSS styling

â”œâ”€ script.js               # JavaScript logic

â”œâ”€ app.py                  # Optional Python backend server

â”œâ”€ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies

â”œâ”€ README.md               # This file



How It Works
1.	User inputs ingredients in the input box.
2.	JS checks the ingredient against the built-in nutrition database.
3.	Nutritional info per ingredient is calculated based on standard portion sizes.
4.	Total meal macros are summed and analyzed.
5.	Feedback and recommendations are displayed.

Future Enhancements

â€¢	Add support for more ingredients and regional foods.

â€¢	Integrate with an external nutrition API for real-time data.

â€¢	Allow users to save meal logs.

â€¢	Add ML-based meal suggestions for specific diets (keto, vegan, etc.)
