Technologies Used
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

•	Backend (optional): Python Flask for a server version

•	IDE: VS Code

How to Run Locally
Option 1: HTML + JS Only
1.	Clone the repo:
git clone <your-repo-url>
2.	Open index.html in your browser or use VS Code Live Server.
Option 2: With Python Flask
1.	Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
2.	Install requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.	Run the server:
python app.py
4.	Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

├─ venv/                   # Virtual environment

├─ index.html              # Main HTML file

├─ style.css               # CSS styling

├─ script.js               # JavaScript logic

├─ app.py                  # Optional Python backend server

├─ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies

├─ README.md               # This file



How It Works
1.	User inputs ingredients in the input box.
2.	JS checks the ingredient against the built-in nutrition database.
3.	Nutritional info per ingredient is calculated based on standard portion sizes.
4.	Total meal macros are summed and analyzed.
5.	Feedback and recommendations are displayed.

Future Enhancements

•	Add support for more ingredients and regional foods.

•	Integrate with an external nutrition API for real-time data.

•	Allow users to save meal logs.

•	Add ML-based meal suggestions for specific diets (keto, vegan, etc.)
